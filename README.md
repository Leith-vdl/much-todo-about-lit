<h1>Much To-Do About Lit</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b>
<br>
This app was built as a means to strengthen my knowledge of Lit, and web components as a whole. It is a simple To-Do list application that allows the user to type in a task into the input field, where it will then be added to an array, and appended with a button that will mark it as complete, adding a line through the task, and a delete button to remove the task from the list. It also has a dark mode toggle feature, why not? It is built almost entierly in JavaScript and styled using Bootstrap 5.3.
